Building A GraphQL API
======================

Follow the instructions below to create a GraphQL server.

In any convenient location, create a new directory named "graphql-api".

Open a command prompt within the newly created directory and run the command "npm init -y".

Still within the "graphql-api" directory, run the command "npm install apollo-server@^2 graphql@^14.6.0".

Within the "graphql-api" directory, create a subdirectory named "src".

Within the newly created "src" directory, create a new empty file named "index.js", containing the text given between the horizontal lines below.

____

const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server");

const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    info: String!
  }
`;

const resolvers =
{
	Query:
	{
		info: () => "This is a GraphQL API."
	}
}

const server = new ApolloServer
({
  	typeDefs,
  	resolvers,
});

server.listen().then
(
	( server ) => console.log("Server is running on " + server.url + "...")
);

From within the graphql-api directory, run the command "node src/index.js".
